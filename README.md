SpotiShush is a browser add-on that automatically mutes audio ads on [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/).

# Q&A

## Why not use an Ad Blocker instead?

While some Spotify audio ads can be a bit annoying, Spotify itself is amazing and I like support them by disabling my Ad Blocker on their website. Also, I feel like if everybody decided to use an Ad Blocker on Spotify, the amazing service they offer for free users might disappear.

## How does it work?

SpotiShush automatically detects when an audio advertising is about to be played, then **it mutes only the tab** where the ad is being played. After the ad finishes, SpotiShush unmutes the tab (unless another ad plays in sequence).
