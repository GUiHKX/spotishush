SpotiShush is a browser add-on that automatically mutes audio ads on [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/).

# Q&A

## Why not use an Ad Blocker instead?

While some Spotify audio ads can be a bit annoying, Spotify itself is amazing and I like support them by disabling my Ad Blocker on their website. Also, I feel like if everybody decided to use an Ad Blocker on Spotify, the amazing service they offer for free users might disappear.

## How does it work?

SpotiShush automatically mutes the Spotify tab in your browser before it plays any audio ad. After the ad finishes, SpotiShush unmutes the tab so you can enjoy your favorite songs again.
